# Combat Logic

Battles in Epoch 8800 resolve in three layers:

1. **Shield Phase** – optional. Units with shield abilities absorb damage here.
2. **Structure & Defense Phase** – defensive buildings and fortifications exchange fire.
3. **Unit-on-unit Combat** – surviving units fight until one side retreats or is destroyed.

## Counter Matrix
- **Stealth** counters **Heavy Armor**.
- **EMP** counters **Stealth**.
- **Plasma** counters **Shields**.
- **Scouts** are weak against everything.

Legendary units will be limited to one per account (not yet implemented).
