# Health Check

## Build & Test Status
- `npm run build` – succeeded
- `npm test` – succeeded
- `npm audit fix` – 4 critical vulnerabilities remain via `firebase-admin` → `protobufjs`
- Manual tick test (`mockTickTest.ts`) failed: `PlayerData` and `ResourceState` not exported from `tickSystem`

## Observations
- Official typings and runtime packages for React, Phaser, Recharts, Supertest, Jest, and Firebase Admin are installed; stub declarations removed.
- Event-driven features (login, queues, PvE missions) compiled and tested, but end-to-end interaction with a real server and database remains unverified.
- Firestore integration currently relies on an in-memory fallback; real Firebase credentials and integration tests are pending.
- Ran `npm audit fix`; critical `protobufjs` vulnerability persists via `firebase-admin` dependency

## Recommended Follow-up
- Add integration tests for event bus flows once backend services are available.
- Configure Firebase credentials and validate persistence against a live Firestore instance.
- Address reported npm vulnerabilities
