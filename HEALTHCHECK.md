# Health Check

## Build & Test Status
- `npm run build` – succeeded
- `npm test` – succeeded

## Observations
- Stub type declarations for React, Phaser, Recharts, Supertest, Jest, and Firebase Admin are used to keep the sandbox lightweight. Install official packages when moving to a full environment.
- Event-driven features (login, queues, PvE missions) compiled and tested, but end-to-end interaction with a real server and database remains unverified.
- Firestore integration currently relies on an in-memory fallback; real Firebase credentials and integration tests are pending.

## Recommended Follow-up
- Replace stub typings with official `@types/*` packages and real modules.
- Add integration tests for event bus flows once backend services are available.
- Configure Firebase credentials and validate persistence against a live Firestore instance.
